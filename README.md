## Project Description
This project showcases the use of a PIC16F877A microcontroller to read the value of two LDRs and compare their value to move a solar panel mounted on a servo. The angle of the servo is continously changed depending on the side with the most light (Exceeding a certain threshold) using interrupts and the PIC16F877A CCP module in the compare mode.
